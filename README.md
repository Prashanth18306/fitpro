# ⚡ ForgeFit — Your Ultimate Fitness Companion

ForgeFit is a modern, responsive web application designed to help users track their training, stay motivated, and achieve their fitness goals. Built with a focus on speed, aesthetics, and ease of use.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Launch)

Getting ForgeFit up and running on your local machine is simple and automated:

1.  **Run the Launch Script**: Double-click the `launch_website.bat` file in the project folder.
2.  **Auto-Launch**: The script will automatically start a local Node.js server and open your default browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

*Note: If you don't have Node.js installed, the script will attempt to use Python as a fallback or open the files directly.*

## ✨ Features

- **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- **Dynamic Content**: Interactive UI elements for an engaging training experience.
- **Fast Local Server**: Optimized Node.js serving for rapid development and preview.
- **One-Click Launch**: Zero configuration required to see the site live locally.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Vanilla), JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Local Server**: Node.js (with built-in `http` and `child_process` modules)
- **Tooling**: Custom batch launch scripts for Windows
